# 3D-Visualization-of-the-Hydrogen-Atom-s-Probability-Density-Based-on-the-Schr-dinger-Equation
This project presents a 3D visualization of the hydrogen atom’s probability density based on the analytical solution of the Schrödinger equation. Using Python and scientific libraries, it models atomic orbitals by computing and rendering the wavefunction's spatial structure for given quantum numbers.
